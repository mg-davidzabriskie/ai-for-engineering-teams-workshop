## Feature: Customer Multi-Select Enhancement

### Context
- Purpose and role in the application: Enable multiple customer selection in the CustomerSelector component for bulk operations like batch analysis, group actions, and comparative views
- How it fits into the larger system: Extends existing single-select functionality to support multi-select patterns common in enterprise dashboards for efficiency and productivity
- Who will use it and when: Customer success teams and account managers who need to perform bulk actions on multiple customers, compare customer metrics, or analyze groups of customers simultaneously

### Requirements
- Functional requirements (what it must do): Support both single and multi-select modes through a toggle or mode prop, maintain selected state across search/filter operations, provide clear selection count indicators, enable select all/deselect all functionality, emit selection arrays to parent components
- User interface requirements: Add selection mode toggle (single/multi), display selection count badge when multiple customers selected, provide visual indicators for multi-select state (checkboxes or multiple highlighting), maintain clear visual distinction between single and multi-select modes, add bulk action controls (select all, clear all)
- Data requirements: Accept selectedCustomerIds array prop for multi-select state control, maintain Customer interface compatibility, support onCustomerSelectionChange callback with array of selected customers, preserve existing single-select API for backward compatibility
- Integration requirements: Seamless integration with existing CustomerCard selection functionality, backward compatibility with current single-select usage, TypeScript strict mode compliance, maintain existing search and filter behavior

### Constraints
- Technical stack and frameworks (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Performance requirements (load times, rendering thresholds): Efficient rendering with large selection arrays, minimal re-renders when selection state changes, optimized selection state updates using React patterns like useCallback and useMemo
- Design constraints (responsive breakpoints, component size limits): Selection controls must work across all breakpoints, multi-select indicators must not significantly impact card layout, maintain existing responsive grid behavior
- File structure and naming conventions: Enhance existing CustomerSelector.tsx and CustomerCard.tsx files, maintain named export patterns, preserve existing test file structure and naming
- Props interface and TypeScript definitions: Extend CustomerSelectorProps with multi-select props while maintaining backward compatibility, add proper TypeScript unions for single/multi-select modes
- Security considerations: Validate selection arrays for proper customer IDs, prevent selection state manipulation through proper controlled component patterns

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CustomerSelector supports both single and multi-select modes
- [ ] Mode toggle allows switching between single and multi-select

- [ ] Accessibility attributes properly announce multi-select state and counts
- [ ] onCustomerSelectionChange callback emits array of selected customers
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing single-select usage
- [ ] All existing tests pass and new multi-select tests added
- [ ] Multi-select state properly controlled by selectedCustomerIds prop
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with large customer datasets and selection arrays
- [ ] Visual design maintains consistency with existing component styling
