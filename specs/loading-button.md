## Feature: Loading Button Component

### Context
- Purpose and role in the application: Interactive button that shows loading state during async operations
- How it fits into the larger system: Core UI component for forms and actions throughout the dashboard
- Who will use it and when: Users performing actions that require server communication or processing time

### Requirements
- Functional requirements (what it must do): Display button text, show loading spinner when active, handle click events, disable interaction during loading
- User interface requirements: Clean button design with smooth loading state transition, accessible loading indicator
- Data requirements: Accept button text, loading state, click handler, and optional disabled state
- Integration requirements: Work seamlessly with forms, async functions, and TypeScript interfaces

### Constraints
- Technical stack and frameworks (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Performance requirements (load times, rendering thresholds): Smooth animation transitions under 200ms
- Design constraints (responsive breakpoints, component size limits): Standard button sizing with spinner that fits within bounds
- File structure and naming conventions: LoadingButton component in src/components/ui/
- Props interface and TypeScript definitions: Strongly typed props with loading, disabled, onClick, and children
- Security considerations: Prevent double-submission during loading states

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Renders button text when not loading
- [ ] Shows loading spinner and disables interaction when loading is true
- [ ] Handles click events only when not loading or disabled
- [ ] Provides proper ARIA labels for screen readers during loading state
- [ ] Smooth transitions between normal and loading states
- [ ] Prevents multiple rapid clicks during async operations
- [ ] Maintains consistent sizing regardless of loading state
