## Feature: CustomerCard Enhancement with Selection Support

### Context
- Purpose and role in the application: Enhance the existing CustomerCard component to support interactive selection functionality while preserving all current features
- How it fits into the larger system: Enables CustomerCard to work seamlessly with CustomerSelector and other parent components that need selection capabilities
- Who will use it and when: Customer success teams and account managers who need to select specific customers from card displays for detailed analysis or actions

### Requirements
- Functional requirements (what it must do): Add click handling for customer selection/deselection, maintain single selection behavior, emit selection events to parent components, preserve all existing CustomerCard functionality including health score display, domain information, and visual styling
- User interface requirements: Provide clear visual feedback for selected state through border highlighting and background changes, maintain accessibility standards with proper ARIA attributes, ensure selection states are keyboard accessible, preserve responsive design across all breakpoints
- Data requirements: Accept optional selectedCustomerId prop to control selection state, maintain compatibility with existing Customer interface from mock-customers.ts, support onCustomerSelect callback for parent communication
- Integration requirements: Seamless integration with existing CustomerSelector component, backward compatibility with current CustomerCard usage, maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Constraints
- Technical stack and frameworks (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Performance requirements (load times, rendering thresholds): No performance degradation from selection functionality, efficient re-rendering when selection state changes, minimal bundle size impact
- Design constraints (responsive breakpoints, component size limits): Maintain current responsive breakpoints, selection visual indicators must not affect card dimensions, preserve existing card styling and branding
- File structure and naming conventions: Enhance existing CustomerCard.tsx file without breaking changes, maintain named export pattern, preserve existing test file structure
- Props interface and TypeScript definitions: Extend current CustomerCardProps interface with selection-related props, maintain backward compatibility for components not using selection features
- Security considerations: Validate customer selection inputs, prevent XSS through proper selection state handling, maintain existing data sanitization

### Acceptance Criteria
