# Code Quality Standards

All code must follow the quality requirements defined in `requirements/code-quality.md`:
- Use descriptive variable and function names (no abbreviations like `btn`, `usr`)
- Add TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components)
- Implement proper error boundaries and error handling
- Prefer named exports over default exports for components
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper loading and error states for async operations
- Use semantic JSX element names that describe purpose, not appearance
